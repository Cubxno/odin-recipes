<h3>ingredient</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 ⅛ lb ground turkey</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 ½ tsp dried thyme</li>
  <li>1 ½ tsp dried parsley</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
  <li>1 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
  <li>½ cup grated cheddar cheese</li>
  <li>4 hamburger buns, toasted</li>
  <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
  <li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
  <li>4 green leaf lettuce leaves</li>
  <li>4 tomato slices</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    In a large bowl, gently mix turkey, Worcestershire, oregano, thyme, parsley,
    garlic, salt and pepper until combined. Divide mixture into 3 even balls;
    firmly press down creating a 5-inch (12 cm) round patty. Using a 2-inch (5
    cm) round cutter, cut out the centre of each patty. Use the cut meat to make
    the fourth patty. Place patties on a small parchment-lined baking sheet;
    freeze for 5 minutes to firm up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat a 10-inch (25 cm) cast iron pan to medium-high heat. Add 1 tbsp (15
    mL) olive oil. Working in batches, cook 2 patties for 6 minutes. Flip and
    crack 1 egg into each hole. Cook for 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low,
    cover and cook egg until desired doneness, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from
    pan and sprinkle each patty with 2 tbsp (30 mL) cheese. Repeat with
    remaining two patties.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spread each bun bottom and top with mayonnaise and ketchup. Place patty on
    bottom bun, followed by lettuce and tomato slice. Finish with bun top. Serve
    warm.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try jazzing it up with different toppings! Make it Greek inspired by
    substituting tomato with sun-dried tomatoes and sliced olives.
